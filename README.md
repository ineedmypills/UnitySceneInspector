# Unity Scene Inspector (Fork)

This is a modified and improved version of the original [Scene Inspector by daancode](https://github.com/daancode/unity-scene-inspector).

This tool extends the default Unity toolbar with powerful scene management utilities. It allows you to quickly switch between scenes, play the game from the first scene in your build settings, and pin your favorite scenes to the toolbar for one-click access.

This fork has been updated for **Unity 2021+** with a more stable toolbar integration, while maintaining compatibility with older versions.


*(UI may vary slightly in newer Unity versions)*

## Features
- **Quick Scene Switching:** A dropdown menu to instantly open any scene in your project.
- **Additive Scene Loading:** Quickly add scenes to the current hierarchy.
- **Play From First Scene:** A dedicated play button that always starts your game from the first scene listed in the Build Settings, no matter which scene is currently open.
- **Scene Shortcuts:** Pin your most-used scenes directly to the toolbar for instant access.
- **Customizable:**
    - Toggle between showing shortcut numbers or full scene names.
    - Filter the scene list to show only scenes included in the build.
    - Automatically restore the last opened scene when you exit Play Mode.
